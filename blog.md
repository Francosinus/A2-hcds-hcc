## R2 - Reflection
> Book: The Practice of Reproducible Research (Chapter 2 and 3)

### Definitions
_How does this relate to the definitions given in the lecture?_
The definitions from the lecture and the website are very similar. Reproducability means that someone else is able to redo all the steps from an original project using the same methods and materials (including data). Replication means that the methods (or the theory) which are used are applied to new data. 
####Reproducability
_Lecture Definition_
>A research project is computationally reproducable if a second investigator can recreate the final reported results of the project, including key quantitative findings, tables, and figures, given only a set of files and written instructions. 

_Website Definition_
>The ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results.

####Replication

_Lecture Definition_
>It involves applying the same methods to new data and achieving a commensurate, confirming, or contradictory result.

>The purpose of replication, or an attempt to replicate, is to strengthen the foundation of a theory so that it too will become a part of our general knowledge system.

_Website Definition_
>which refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected.



### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
The reading confirms that it is important to document all the steps of a reserach project, but also describe how to use a software or run the code. This makes it reproducable (and/or replicable) for others. Especially in the research area it is important that new insights are well documented, so other researchers can continue working on the topic. 

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions

1. Making software reproducible can be very laborious. No problem for smaller projects, but when you have huge projects, I imagine it to be very time consuming. How can you make your work reproducible in larger projects with many people but still efficient?

## A2 - Reproducibility Workflow
First I started with getting to know how the different APIs work. Since they are quite similar and we already used them before it was no problem to load the data and write it in json files. The preprocessing steps were quite time consuming, since the data needed to be in a certain format for the final csv file. Creating the plot went well, thanks to the preprocessing.

The final plot can be seen in the figure below.

### Challenges
The workflow was a good challenge to refresh dealing with pandas data manipulation. All in all I would say it wasn't too hard, but still had to look up some stuff.
